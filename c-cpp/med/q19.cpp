/*
 * In the distant future, the Chronomancers, a civilization mastering time manipulation, encounter an anomaly 
 * in their timeline. 
 * 
 * The universeâ€™s history is connected by Temporal Links, which represent key events in the flow of time.
 * These links form a continuous chain that binds the past, present, and future in a delicate web.
 * However, a great war, caused by a series of key events, threatens the stability of the universe.
 * 
 * The Chronomancers must undo the damage done by this conflict, and to do so, they have developed the Chrono Loop.
 * The Chrono Loop allows them to reverse the order of Temporal Links in a single pass, effectively rewinding history 
 * and fixing the sequence of events.
 * 
 * You are the main protagonist of the story, Debian The Damned, despite your cynical attitude, you decide to use
 * the Chrono Loop, but there are some anomalies within the device that you must fix before time-reversals.
