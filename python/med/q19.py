"""
 # In the distant future, the Chronomancers, a civilization mastering time manipulation, encounter an anomaly 
 # in their timeline. 
 # 
 # The universeâ€™s history is connected by Temporal Links, which represent key events in the flow of time.
 # These links form a continuous chain that binds the past, present, and future in a delicate web.
 # However, a great war, caused by a series of key events, threatens the stability of the universe.
 # 
 # The Chronomancers must undo the damage done by this conflict, and to do so, they have developed the Chrono Loop.
 # The Chrono Loop allows them to reverse the order of Temporal Links in a single pass, effectively rewinding history 
 # and fixing the sequence of events.
 # 
 # You are the main protagonist of the story, Debian The Damned, despite your cynical attitude, you decide to use
 # the Chrono Loop, but there are some anomalies within the device that you must fix before time-reversals.
