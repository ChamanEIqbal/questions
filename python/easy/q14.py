"""
In the land of Arithmetica, there was a legend of a powerful spellâ€”"Matrix Multiplication." 
It was said that anyone who could properly perform the multiplication of matrices could gain knowledge of the secrets
of the universe. 

But the trick was, the dimensions of the matrices must align perfectly; otherwise, the multiplication would fail.
